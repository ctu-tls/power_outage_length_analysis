# Power Outage Length Analysis Based on Type of Cause
by Claire Tu (c7tu@ucsd.edu) and Po-Hua Chen (poc008@ucsd.edu)


##Introduction

### Power Outages

Power outages affect far more than just lights turning off. They interrupt daily routines, disrupt communication, pause business operations, and bring safety risks. Whether caused by extreme weather, equipment failures, or human activity, outages impact millions of households each year and expose how dependent our modern lives are on stable electricity. As climate events intensify and energy demand increases, understanding when and why outages occur has become increasingly important. In this project, we analyze major power outages in the United States to uncover trends over time, compare different causes, and identify factors that influence outage length. By approaching the data systematically, we aim to highlight why outage patterns could matter for communities, policymakers, and anyone who relies on a reliable power system.

##Assessment of Missingness
Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated automatically from a DataFrame, using

print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
